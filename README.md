Using different codes by python to explore data of bikeshare. I learned many fundamental codes through python to get user input for city (Chicago, New York city, Washington), get user input for month (all, January, February, ... , June), get user input for day of week (all, Monday, Tuesday, ... Sunday), load data file into a data frame, convert the Start Time column to datetime, extract month and day of week from Start Time to create new columns, filter by month if applicable, use the index of the months list to get the corresponding int, filter by month to create the new data frame, filter by day of week if applicable, filter by day of week to create the new data frame, display the most common month, display the most common day of week and display mean travel time.
